title: " Thresholded Adaptive Validation: Tuning the Graphical Lasso for Graph Recovery "
abstract: " Many Machine Learning algorithms are formulated as regularized optimization
  problems, but their performance hinges on a regularization parameter that needs
  to be calibrated to each application at hand. In this paper, we propose a general
  calibration scheme for regularized optimization problems and apply it to the graphical
  lasso, which is a method for Gaussian graphical modeling. The scheme is equipped
  with theoretical guarantees and motivates a thresholding pipeline that can improve
  graph recovery. Moreover, requiring at most one line search over the regularization
  path, the calibration scheme is computationally more efficient than competing schemes
  that are based on resampling. Finally, we show in simulations that our approach
  can improve on the graph recovery of other approaches considerably. "
